## Reflection
In hindsight, the functional aspect of the application was utilized in a straightforward manner. Once a fundamental understanding of the necessary methods is acquired, the logic under the hood will become self-evident. To my surprise, I felt most hindered in my productivity by Tailwind's CSS framework. Though, it provides a wide range of utilities and is practically similar to boostrap, its understandable as to why it is such a well respected tool. Unlike bootstrap however, do not expect to feel any producible competence within a few days. It is a powerful framework that deserves a little extra time spent becoming genuinely familiar with prior to any sort of short term project.
